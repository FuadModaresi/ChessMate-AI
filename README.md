## ü§ñ The AI Opponent

The AI opponent in ChessMate AI is powered by a large language model through Google's Genkit. The prompt is carefully engineered to make the AI evaluate the board based on strategic principles like material advantage, positional control, and king safety. This creates a more dynamic and less predictable opponent than traditional chess engines.
